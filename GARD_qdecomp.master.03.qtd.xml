    <Text>I have cherubism. I was diagnosed at age 3 and had the tumor surgically removed at age 13. Then I had implants placed for permanent teeth at age 20. Today I live normally. My main concern and reason for contact is: I'd like to know more about the cause of cherubism. How or why did I get it? There is no history in either of my families of cherubism. What are the signs and symptoms of cherubism? Do my future children run a strong risk? Can I be tested to see if I am a carrier? If I find that I am not a carrier can they still turn up with the disease? Is there prenatal testing available for cherubism. As you can see, I am mostly concerned for the future of my family. I do not have kids yet, but do plan to.</Text>

He has had a liver transplant at 6 months due to liver failure, coagulopathy, ascites, protein losing enteropathy (?), failure to thrive, and hypoglycemia. CT and MRI do not show any brain abnormalities.  He does not yet crawl or stand on his own, possibly because he was hospitalized for four months. I am worried about his developmental delay. He does have minimal delay in speech.</Text>
